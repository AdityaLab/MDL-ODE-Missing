We also provide a demo code to run MDLINFER. The steps are as follow: 

(1) Please set the code_root in scripts_main/Run_SEIR_main_analysis.R in step1 folder and step2 folder.  
(2) Run the MDLINFER.sh.  
(3) You can find the total infections D* saved in D_star.txt.

This demo code is based on the SAPHIRE model. Here, we save the step 1 calibration results of attempting different reported rate alpha. The demo code usually takes 1-2 hours to run.
