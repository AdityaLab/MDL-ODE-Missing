## Setup

The code is running on python 3 and R.
Most python packages and R packages used in the code can be installed directly via pip (for python) or install.packages() command (for R). Specially, running the SEIR+HD model code needs the pomp page of R, the detail of this package can be found here: https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/

## Dataset

  The dataset used in this article are: 

### New York Times reported infections
	daily time sequence of reported COVID-19 infections.

### Serological studies
	Serological studies from CDC and commerical laboratories to estimate the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in 10 US locations every 3â€“4 weeks from March to July 2020.

### Symptomatic surveillance

## Running the code

### Step 1 Algorithm

Run 'alpha.py' to do a linear search to find a good reported rate.

### Step 2 Algorithm

Given the alpha_reported found in step 1, run 'D.py' to use an optimization method to find the D* that minimizes MDL cost with reported rate constraints.
